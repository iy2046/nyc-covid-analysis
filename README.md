# nyc-covid-analysis

In this project, I leveraged data sourced from NYC Open Data, which encompasses a diverse range of COVID-19 statistics specific to New York City. Using the Java programming language, I developed a MapReduce job aimed at deriving insights from this dataset. Specifically, my analysis focused on computing the maximum 7-day average death count spanning the years 2020 to 2022. This approach enabled an in-depth understanding of the pandemic’s impact over time, providing valuable insights into the progression of COVID-19 within the city.

The results are organized as follows: “Year, death_count_7day_avg”
